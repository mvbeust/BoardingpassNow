1. The Problem:  
   Airlines are good at creating boarding passes, but they're not good as providing them to you in the way you _actually_ want them.

2. The solution:  
   I built this small webapp based on Google Scripts and Sheets that takes all the information you can provide (including a link to the QR code) and sends it to your email.

3. Why does it need access to your Google account?  
   Because Google only trusts two kinds of accounts: your own and verified accounts. In order to verify an account for boarding passes, I would have to send a ton of daily mails, so it's easier to use your super credibility and send an email from your own account to your own account.

4. Is this made for public use?  
   No.
